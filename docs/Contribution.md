# How can I contribute?
* [I know programming!](https://nisargsuthar.github.io/VeritasDocs/Contribution/#i-know-programming)
* [I love technical writing!](https://nisargsuthar.github.io/VeritasDocs/Contribution/#i-love-technical-writing)
* [I'm know color theory!](https://nisargsuthar.github.io/VeritasDocs/Contribution/#i-know-color-theory)

### I know programming
You can write a parser for an artifact you like and submit a PR [here](https://github.com/nisargsuthar/Veritas){target=_blank}!
Alternatively, you can suggest bug fixes and/or code optimizations for `python` and `kivy`.

For guidelines, visit the official [Veritas Documentation](https://nisargsuthar.github.io/VeritasDocs/Flow/) to better understand the project structure and control flow.

### I love technical writing
You can improve the existing documentation found [here](https://github.com/nisargsuthar/VeritasDocs){target=_blank}.
Documentation is generated by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/){target=_blank} which is super easy to set up and learn!

### I know color theory
You can improve the color dictionary present in [`colors.py`](https://github.com/nisargsuthar/Veritas/blob/main/colors.py){target=_blank} by adding colors, deleting dull ones, and re-ordering so that no colors in close proximity share a same hue value.
