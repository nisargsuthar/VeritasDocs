# Artifact Specific Modules

This type of modules contain the entire template parsing code written by the contributors. Throughout the documentation, `artifact.py` refers to a specific module written and submitted by contributors. Anywhere the keyword `artifact` is used in variable names and functions, also refer to the name of the artifact. It is not literal, but a placeholder to generalize documentation process.

So just as an example, if a contributor were to submit a module for `prefetch` files (which is already completed), a variable like `artifacttemplate` would have to be inferred as `prefetchtemplate`.

Similarly, a function such as `artifactTemplate()` would mean `prefetchTemplate()`.
