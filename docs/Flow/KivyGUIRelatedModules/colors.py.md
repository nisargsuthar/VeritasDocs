# colors.py

Contains a large dictionary with color name as keys and Kivy markup color tags as string values.

Contributors can improve the dictionary by following principles:

* Any color should have a high contrast between itself and the complete black used as background.
* All colors should have a high luminescence value in order to not appear dull over the black background.
* Colors within their respective proximities must not have a collection of same shade. In other words, more oppositeness in the hue values is preferred.
* Colors belonging to the grays and whites families must be avoided as they can be too dull or too bright over the black background.
