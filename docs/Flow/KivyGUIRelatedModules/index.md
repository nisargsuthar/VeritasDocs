`veritas.kv` is a Kivy layout file which specifies the views to render. It contains basic components such as buttons for opening and closing a file, and two `RecycleViews` for application data.

`colors.py` contains a dictionary of color values in hexadecimal wrapped by the Kivy markup color tag `[color=XXXXXX]`. These colors are used for subsequent sections within an artifact file structure.
